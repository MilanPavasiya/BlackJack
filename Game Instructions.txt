You lose = 
1. Dealer gets closer to 21 than you
2. You go over 21(busts)

2-10 = Face  (Points) 
Jack, Queen, King = 10 
Ace = 1 or 11

default 2 cards and one card of the dealer is unseen
- we can add more card 
- dealer or player has less points cards ...dealer or player has to add(hit) a card point(if Dealer has worse hand than a player -- player wins else dealer wins )
	--if player wins then he/she will receive the equal amount with they were 		playing.
	--if player lose then they lose the entire bet 
	--if dealer and player has the same value (push) ...next game will begin 

*Ace + 10 value card(J or Q or K or 10) --on first two cards wins automatically (blackjack)[3:2(150%) table or 6:5 table]

Playing Decisions(4)
1. Hitting -- when you needed some extra points closer to 21 (double tab on the table)
2. Standing -- don't want another card (wave the hand)
3. Splitting -- same cards (we can play with the two or more hands + adding a card(hit) to continue )
4. Doubling Down 
(Pro tip - Never double down for less than the full amount)

condition -- when player and a user has a ace up
	-- we can play with the insurance(2:1) 

surrender -- you gonna lose half of your money
